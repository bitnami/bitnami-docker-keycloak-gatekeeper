# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

> NOTE: Debian 9 and Oracle Linux 7 images have been deprecated in favor of Debian 10 images. Bitnami will not longer publish new Docker images based on Debian 9 or Oracle Linux 7.

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

# Prerequisites

To run this application you need [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) >= `1.10.0`. [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose) is recommended with a version `1.6.0` or later.

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Keycloak Gatekeeper Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the
[list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper/tags/)
in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-keycloak-gatekeeper.git#master:9/scratch'
```

# Configuration

## Using a configuration file

The configuration can easily be setup by mounting your own configuration file on the directory `/opt/bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper/conf` (both JSON and YAML formats are supported: `config.json` or `config.yaml`).

```bash
$ docker run --name keycloak-gatekeeper \
  --volume /path/to/config.yaml:/opt/bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper/config.yaml \
  bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper:latest \
  /keycloak-gatekeeper --config /opt/bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper/config.yaml
```

After that, your configuration will be taken into account in Keycloak Gatekeeper.

You can do this using Docker Compose by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-keycloak-gatekeeper/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
keycloak-gatekeeper:
  ...
  command: /keycloak-gatekeeper --config /opt/bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper/config.yaml
  volumes:
    - /path/to/config.yaml:/opt/bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper/config.yaml:ro
  ...
```

## Using command-line options

The configuration can also be setup by providing command-line options.

```bash
$ docker run --name keycloak-gatekeeper bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper:latest /keycloak-gatekeeper \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:3000 \
  --upstream-url http://127.0.0.1:80 \
  --discovery-url https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/<REALM_NAME> \
  --client-id <CLIENT_ID>
```

You can do this using Docker Compose by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-keycloak-gatekeeper/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
keycloak-gatekeeper:
  ...
  command:
    - /keycloak-gatekeeper
    - --listen
    - 127.0.0.1:3000
    - --upstream-url
    - http://127.0.0.1:80
    - --discovery-url
    - https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/<REALM_NAME>
    - --client-id
    - <CLIENT_ID>
  ...
```
